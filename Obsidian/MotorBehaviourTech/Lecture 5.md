This is one possible implementation of optocouplers in order to isolate two main parts of an amplifier for EMG, to avoid them to be in contact for any hazard for the patient

The main noise sources that might affect EMG detection signal:
* Interferences of the environment: before or after the measurement, bef: there are EMI noise irradiated on the body and after or during by various muscles...
* Error measurements, also depending on the wrong design of the system which might depend on variable electrodes impedances (interface between body and EMG machine) $z_1$ $z_2$ are impedances of the body and electrodes of the patient and can be unbalanced, ideally they're equal and stable in time
* After the electrode area we have the signal amplification and processing, we see we have a shadowed loop area which would create some interferences due to the variable magnetic field flux.
* Stray capacitances due to capacitance coupling which would produce stray currents.
We see there is a electrode grounded/reference voltage connected in the Left leg.

We can also classify noises as:

LF: double layer of electrode-electrolyte is variable thus it also produces noise.

Signal above has a un-stable baseline which changes due to noise.

This change on baseline could be to the motion of the patient or motion of the area.

It is LF noise and it is easy to be removed by filters.

By twisting the cable we change the direction of magnetic flux and it would somehow cancel out the noise produced by it.

EMG might be affected by heart crosstalk (1Hz peaks) thus stable correct electrodes placement is needed

Negative feedback (right leg drive circuit â€“ safety and CMRR).

Here we show all the noise that we can find in any kind of electrophysiological signals.

Red block is the amplifier with all of its non-idealities which are generated in input signals.

Here we see noise coming from the environment.

Inside of an INA IC, there are the three opAmps, and all of the resistors in the second stage has the same value cos it is gain 1. 

We can modify RG to get different gains,

Do we connect it to the physical ground connection?

There is a positive loop which would lead to un-stability. To avoid it we do the partition...

varicap diodes, change their capacitance by varying their voltage in reverse bias. 

Reverse bias controls the thickness of the depletion zone.
