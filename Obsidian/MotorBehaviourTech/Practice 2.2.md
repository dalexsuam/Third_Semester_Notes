We continue with filtering and we're gonna do an exercise of MA filter

We control cut-off f using less or more points...

If we use less points, the response would be slower.

This is time domain response of the signal

Noise sources:

this is how noise affect our signal

ECG artifacts is repeated with very high peaks in the freq of interest, so we need to remove somehow. Some muscles it is difficult cos it is close to the heart.

There is baseline drift. Due to the movement of the artifact. Then we have the ECG artifact repeated and very high in the resting phase.

This is another solution
