When we say a **muscle fiber (muscle cell) is “multinucleated”**, it simply means:

- Most cells in your body (like skin cells) have **one nucleus**.
    
- A **muscle fiber** is very long (it can be several centimeters!). Because of that size, it needs **many nuclei** spread along it to control all its functions.
    
- So instead of one nucleus, it has **dozens to hundreds of nuclei** inside a single cell.

👉 Think of it like this:  
Imagine a **train** that is very long.

- If it had only one “control cabin” (one nucleus), it would be hard to manage the whole train.
    
- Instead, it has **many cabins along the train**, so each section can be managed.
    

That’s why skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated — it helps them work efficiently.
