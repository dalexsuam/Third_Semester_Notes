Imagine the **muscle** is like a rope tied between two objects:

- One end is tied to something **fixed** (doesnâ€™t move much). â†’ Thatâ€™s the **origin**.
    
- The other end is tied to something that **can move** when you pull the rope. â†’ Thatâ€™s the **insertion**.

ðŸ‘‰ **Example with the arm (simplest case):**

- The **biceps muscle** (the one in the front of your arm) is attached at **two points**:
    
    - One end (origin) is attached up near your **shoulder** â†’ that part doesnâ€™t move much.
        
    - The other end (insertion) is attached to your **forearm** â†’ that part moves when you bend your elbow.
        

So, when the biceps **contracts (shortens)**, it pulls the forearm **closer to the shoulder** â†’ your arm bends.
