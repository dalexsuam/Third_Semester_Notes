Muscular structure

Muscle -> Fascicles -> muscle fibers

Muscle fibers -> actin and the other protein

Muscle cannot contract without a signal coming form the nervous system. Every muscle fibers is connected to a motor neuron which is going to trigger the contraction

MOTOR UNIT: Motor neuron + Fibers innervated.

One muscle is innervated by different motor neurons/ Motor neuron pool cluster of motor neurons that innervate the same muscle

one motor neuron innervate different fibres of one muscle. All or none law, the neuron spikes and all fibers innervated contract.

Innervation ratio...

One fiber is inervated by one and only one motor neuron.

HOW THE SIGNAL TRAVELS? From the spinal cord to the muscular fiber and it is an action potential triggered by an external stimulus... It flows from the nucleus of the neuron through the axon unidirectionally. 

EMG Signal generation. Placing two electrodes only allow us to read the motor unit action potential which is a sum of APs of a single motor unit.


What if electrodes position is changed? The signal changes as well, cos it reads the signal w.r.t to the distance of the electrode, and there will be some delays depending on that distance and the velocity of the fiber conduction.


And the amplitude of the signal would be relative dependingof this signal, the propagation coefficient a, and the max signal amplitude.
