Signal generation is a key phase, because both the mechanical and electrical properties of muscle activity originate here. To properly acquire and process EMG signals, it is important to understand how they are generated.

![[EMG_Signal_Hierarchichal_structure.png| 500]]

As shown in the image, muscle has a **hierarchical structure**. The muscle is attached to the **bone** through the **tendon** (insertion at the distal end). From there, we move into the **muscle belly**, which is made up of smaller bundles called **fascicles**. Each fascicle contains **muscle fibers**, and within each fiber we find the **myofibrils**. Going even deeper, we reach the **sarcomeres**, which contain the proteins <span style="color:rgb(2, 141, 192)"><b>actin</b></span> and<span style="color:rgb(71, 215, 140)"> <b>myosin</b></span>.

It is precisely at this protein level, inside the sarcomeres, where contraction happens and the <b>electrical signals are generated</b>. These signals then propagate through the muscle fibers and can be captured on the surface as the EMG signal. 

Although the contraction is linked with chemical and electrical activity it wasn't always like that. 

*Let's go back some years in time*

## <span style="color:rgb(239, 179, 1)">Historical Perspective</span>

The process of muscle contraction has long fascinated scientists. Today, we know that contraction is linked to **chemical and electrical activity** inside the muscle fibers. However, in the past, very different ideas were proposed:

1. <span style="color:rgb(161, 40, 226)"><b>Balloonist Theory (Cerebrospinal Fluid – CFS)</b></span>  The Greek physician **Galen** believed that muscles contracted because a fluid flowed into them. For nearly **1500 years**, people thought that nerves were hollow tubes carrying this fluid. Later, **René Descartes** suggested that "animal spirits" traveled from the brain’s ventricles through the nerves to the muscles, causing contraction.

   This idea can be compared to **pneumatic artificial muscles** used in robotics today, where a sleeve is inflated with air or liquid. The inflation makes the muscle belly expand, shortening its length.
   
2. <span style="color:rgb(161, 40, 226)"><b>The Discovery of Animal Electricity</b></span>  In **1791**, **Luigi Galvani** challenged the fluid-based theories. He discovered that electricity played a key role in muscle movement. By touching a frog’s spinal cord and legs with a metal instrument made of copper and zinc, he observed the frog’s legs twitch. This acted like a simple battery, generating a potential that caused contraction.

- From this, Galvani concluded that the force behind contraction was **electrical energy carried by ions**, not fluid. He called this phenomenon **“animal electricity.”**
- Other experiments showed that even **atmospheric electricity** (for example, from thunderstorms) could trigger contractions in frogs.

3. <span style="color:rgb(161, 40, 226)"><b>The Leyden Jar: Early Capacitor</b></span>  Around the same time, scientists used the **Leyden jar**, one of the first capacitors, to store electrical charge. By releasing the stored energy, they could also stimulate muscle contractions. This helped reinforce the connection between **electricity and muscle activity**.
   
4. <span style="color:rgb(161, 40, 226)"><b>From Galvanism to Electrophysiology</b>  </span> Galvani’s nephew, **Giovanni Aldini**, continued these experiments, even applying electricity to human cadavers in an attempt to revive them. These dramatic demonstrations inspired the idea of _Dr. Frankenstein_. Although they could not restart the heart, these studies established the foundation of **electrophysiology**:
	- Muscles are **activated by electricity**.
	- Muscles also **generate electricity when contracting** — and this is exactly what is measured with **Electromyography (EMG).**

Electromyography is the technique used to record and study the electrical signals generated by muscles when they contract.

> *“… is the study of muscle function through the inquiry of the electrical signal the muscle emanate” (i.e. myo-electric signals) (Basmajian JV, De Luca C, Muscles alive, 1985)*

==We might encounter two types of EMG==

| **Neurological EMG**                                                                                 | **Kinesiological EMG**                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performed under **static conditions** (not during movement).                                         | Performed **during movement**, while muscles are active.                      |
| Focuses on the **micro level**, recording the activity of a **small number of muscle fibers**        | Works at the **macroscopic level**, involving **many muscle fibers at once**. |
| Useful for studying how nerve signals are transmitted to muscles, and how individual fibers respond. | Typically uses **surface electrodes** placed on the skin.                     |
|                                                                                                      | Useful for analyzing overall muscle activation during functional tasks.       |
Now, the important point is that muscle activation has a **stochastic, or random, nature**. The signal we measure is never from a single fiber; it always comes from the combined effect of many fibers. In neurological EMG this randomness is visible at the micro scale, while in kinesiological EMG it becomes even more evident at the macro scale, where the signal represents the average contribution of a large number of fibers.
