If we think in surface electrodes, we can detect only muscles close to the surface of the skin/ of the muscle. We can't detect deep seated muscles. We can't forget the crosstalk, we're detecting more than one muscle information, thus, combination of different muscles.  Specially if we're going to use small electrodes to try to avoid the ocurrence of crosstalk.

The smaller the electrode, the smaller the efecct of the cross-talk

The position of the electrode is critical because it changes redically the output if location is changed. We should try to find a method for reproducing the ideal position of the electrodes during this acquisition and this can be done by using anatomical landmarks.

Popular places to place correctly electrodes, with respect to the landmark.

Then, we have be repeteable from one to other experiment, and we place the electrodes w.r.t a landmark. For example, C7 landmark is in the vertebra...

We have the yellow spots where the electrodes must be positioned and we'll place it to take the activity of a certain muscle. The circles are places for fine-wires electrodes, while the other are for surface electrodes.

There are several sources of noises which must be avoided, cos it'll superimpose the data collected by the electrodes. One classical effect is by the so-called measurement artifacts which can be motivated by:
* Electrode-electrolyte-skin model, where we have the electrical model, if we move the electrode w.r.t the skin, i'll modify the straight capacitance of the double layer of charges which is located between the electrode and the skin, we'll have a motion of the electrode w.r.t the skin and we'll obtain a different activity of the muscle. We can't reduce this by stabilizing the resistive part of the electrode model. If we're able to stabilize it with a completely not polarizable electrode... The idea is to reduce the motion, so keep in place the electrode, something which would be ideally non-polarizable electrode
* Variations of temperature if the electrodes are not exactly at the same temperature, we'll have a variation related to the Nernst potential which shows a dependance on the temperature.
* Another motivation is the sweating which changes the concentration of the electrolyte and will make variations on the reading of the potentials, due to the variation of the chemical activity of the electrolyte. The activity is not the concentration but the variability of molecules for the reaction.

What are the requirements for signal conditioning?
The capacitive and resistive contact impedance must be in the order of 10k and 1M ohms.

The electrode half-cell potential will be up 200mV variable. When we're doing measurements with Ag-AgCl electrode we'll be dealing with this half-cell potential, which is a lot, but by using diff electrodes so we can subtract this half-cell potential which will reduce a lot the 200mV.

Then we always have the presence of the thermal noise intrinsic in the tissue-electrode interface. 
$V_{th,RMS}=\sqrt{4kTRB}$
T temperature, R resistor, B bandwidth, k Boltzmann constant. We have as example 0.18$\mu V$ for R=10k$\Omega$, T=303 and B= 200Hz. The way we design the circuit we have to keep into account this contribution.

The noise generated by ionic exchanges at the tissue-electrode interface. The simple fact that  there are ionic exchanges passing through the interface is adding error in the same order of magnitude or higher than the thermal noise.

EMG has an amplitude ranging from noise level to 5-6mV for surface signals.

There are other effects, called ohmic overpotential, cause it is related to the contact potential. 

There are different types of overpotential

Concentration overpotential, not ohmic effect but it is due to the current which is generated by redox current.

Effects of electrodes...

Due to spatial filtering, if we consider an electrode, depending on the sides of this electrode we'll have different information. This could be seen by looking at the electrode and we'll have different current generators which are located in to the body if we suppose these currents are located on the electrode. The electrode is suppose to be isopotential, then current iu is given by the summation of these current generator which take information from inside of the body. Putting the electrode on these generators is equivalent to looking at the output current iu which is the summation of the different spot currents.

If we consider a simple model with three currents, if we sum them up we'll obtain their spatial summation in time 
![[Pasted image 20250924090842.png]]

If we take the power spectrum of the currents. What we see is that the three spectra of the currents are in higher level at the beginning. The more the spatial frequency the more the decrease in amplitude.

How the electromyograph is built? This is the complete system...

We have 1. differential electrodes at the body of the patient, which have also a reference. 
2. in the opAmp we need to have very high CMRR for reducing the noise produced by common-mode, same values on the two electrodes.
3. bla bla bla
4. Isolation through Electromagnetic or optocoupling approach we're going to isolate the signal acquisition from the electrical grid but also we're going to provide power supply to the signal acquisition chain. The isolation barrier is either: transformer, or optocoupler (a LED and photodiode)
5. AD conversion

Again requierements

We need a filter also for anti-aliasing effect...

![[Pasted image 20250924093112.png]]

There are two different configurations. We start by the monopolar config. In which we have in one input the signal read in the active tissue and in the other a reference electrode. By using the monopolar amplifier we wouldn't reject the common mode noise.

![[Pasted image 20250924093526.png]]

It is more popular to use the differential configuration. This would reduce the size of the working volume. From where the electromyographic amplifier will catch the information. This would be different depending on the size of the electrode and the distance between them.

![[Pasted image 20250924093628.png]]

Here we see working volume :). The distance between the active part where two electrodes are place. The closer the electrodes, the smaller the working volume.

![[Pasted image 20250924093728.png]]


It is possible to cancel out the common mode noise theoretically speaking. We have here the two signals $e_{k}(t)$ which would have a correspondent noise and after passing through the amplifier, we have an amplification in which the both noises if equal they'll cancel out.

![[Pasted image 20250924094041.png]]

In the real case we wouldn't be able to do it. 

![[Pasted image 20250924094108.png]]

And that is why a high CMRR is needed...

![[Pasted image 20250924094307.png]]


This is an example of INA amplifier. The main advantages:
* Input impedance
* Higher CMRR


![[Pasted image 20250924094646.png]]
If patient is grounded and receives very high voltage, there would be a big amount of current flowing through them. EMG device need to include applied parts (AP).

![[Pasted image 20250924095117.png]]

There is this IEC60601-1 standard which deals with the safety of electrical medical devices, which should be guaranteed...

![[Pasted image 20250924095728.png]]


Type B applied parts may be connected to earth/ground, while Type BF and CF are 'floating (body or heart floating)

Devices are marked with certification symbols CE.
